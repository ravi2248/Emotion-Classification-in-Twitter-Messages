    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p>This project is a capstone submission for Mercy University, designed to classify emotions from text data using Natural Language Processing (NLP).</p>
    <h2>Methodology</h2>
    <p>The project compares classic machine learning models (like Logistic Regression and SVM) against more advanced deep learning architectures (like LSTMs). After comprehensive training and evaluation, the <strong>Bidirectional LSTM</strong> was found to be the most effective model, achieving the highest accuracy and the most balanced performance across all six emotion categories.</p>
    <h2>Model Performance Comparison</h2>
    <p>The graph below illustrates the validation accuracy of the best-performing models. It clearly shows the superior performance of the Bidirectional LSTM.</p>
